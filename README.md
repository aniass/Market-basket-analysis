Market basket analysis is a technique that allow to discover the relatonships between products. It is based on searching for the most common combination of products in each transaction. In the analysis I used the Apriori algorithm and the main goal was to sorting the products and creating the best relationship. I used MLxtend library to create the basket analysis.
